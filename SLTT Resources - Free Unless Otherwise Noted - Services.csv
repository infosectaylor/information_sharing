outdated software, the MS-ISAC collects server type and version (IIS, Apache, Nginx, etc.), web programming language and version (PHP, ASP, etc.), 
and content management system and version (WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, etc.) Following the analysis and review of the information returned, data 
will be broken out into two categories: vulnerable and not vulnerable systems. If the system is located in the ‘vulnerable’ file, an associated portion of 
that system is not up to date. Conversely, if the system is located in the ‘not vulnerable' file, the system’s patch level is up to date. Systems identified 
as vulnerable include the CVE score and a link to the CVE.",https://learn.cisecurity.org/ms-isac-registration
