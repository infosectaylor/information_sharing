**SLTT Resources - Free Unless Otherwise Noted**
  
  An SLTT is a US State, Local, Tribal, or Territory government. These governments usually have limited resources, but the US government
  has made available some free resources to use to fill in the knowledge, skill, or infrastructure gaps.

  This document will be useful for SLTTs trying to educate staff or create an incident response plan.
  
  Note: Many of these resources are also available free to critical infrastructure and education industries.
